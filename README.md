# OPENCHESSBOARD_BLE
Firmware for the OPENCHESSBOARD to connect via BLE to Lichess App.

Many Thanks to for providing the PR for supporting BLE devoces to play on Lichess App, as well as providing the base implementation and great examples for supporting external devices via CECEP protocol. Without this as baseline, the BLE support for the openchessboard would not be possible.

Examples for CECP implementation:
